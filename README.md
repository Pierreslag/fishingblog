## Agile Development
Started the agile aproach with thinking about what this website / blog is going to need. Put it down on my notes as a small draft and then got to work with adding the diffrent user stories. Was aiming to get 12 of them.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part, you will want to go over all of your project's features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

You should also mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](insert_html_validator_url_here)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](insert_css_validator_url_here)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, the paucity of time and difficulty understanding the implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub).

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
